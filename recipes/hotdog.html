    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hotdogs are perhaps the most quintessentially American food. Sausages of all sorts made their way here with immigrants from all cultures and were then changed, re-tuned, and altered to cope with new ingredients and fit the needs of American eaters and their increasingly unique palate. One of those sausages eventually begat the hotdog. Deeply entrenched in American culture, hotdogs are also shrouded in mystery, solely the products of giant meat machines and corporations of greater or lesser scrupulosity. But what if you could make hotdogs at home? My friends, you can.</p>
    <p>we’ll lay out the method, science, and thermal principles behind hotdog production and show you how to make this classic American treat in your own kitchen. Do it, and you’ll get gourmet hotdogs that are fine-tuned to your liking, with your choice of cuts, that are better than almost any wiener, frank, or dog you can buy at the market. Let’s get to it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Below are the ingredients for making a delicious hotdog, i hope they will satisfy your taste </p>
    <ul>
        <li> 1150 g well-marbleized beef, cubed (we used short rib with the fat-cap on, silver skin removed)</li>
        <li>23 g fine sea salt</li>
        <li>10 g paprika</li>
        <li>5 g garlic powder</li>
        <li>5 g black pepper</li>
        <li>3 g mustard powder</li>
        <li>g onion powder</li>
        <li>1.5 g pink curing salt</li>
        <li> 230 g crushed ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure your spices and seasonings carefully, especially the curing salt. Set them aside.</li>
        <li>Place the cubed meat in one layer on a parchment-lined sheet pan in the freezer for 20–30 minutes, until firm and stiff on the outside. Also freeze your grinding equipment.</li>
        <li>Grind your beef through a grinder with a fine or medium plate into a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice.</li>
        <li>Combine the ground meat with the seasonings and curing salt. Mix with your hands until the spices are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Add half of the mixture to a large food processor along with half of the crushed ice. Process until the meat is very pasty, very sticky, and well-emulsified. It will look a lot like hotdog meat! As you process, stop every 5–10 seconds to temp with your Thermapen ONE and make sure the mixture is at or below 40°F (4°C).</li>
        <li>Move the batch to a bowl and process the second half, also verifying the temperature and mash the two batches together and mix with your hands to combine them.</li>
        <li>Load your sausage stuffer with your casings and stuff, trying to avoid air bubbles. (Pierce any bubbles with your Thermapen ONE.)</li>
        <li>Link the sausages to lengths you want. We did 7.5″ to match our buns. If using collagen casings, we find that using butcher twine for the first and last tie-off is helpful.</li>
        <li>Place the stuffed sausages, uncovered, in the refrigerator overnight to cure and the next day, preheat your smoker to 180°F (82°C). Use your Smoke’s air probe to monitor the pit temp.</li>
        <li>Place your linked sausages in the smoker with a 2.5″ needle probe inserted into one of them. Close the lid and cook, about 45 minutes, until the high-temp alarm, set to 145°F (62°C), sounds and verify the internal temperature of a few hotdogs using your Thermapen ONE.</li>
        <li>If they are at temp, remove them from heat, snip them apart, and either grill them immediately or give them an ice-water bath to cool them quickly and then store them.</li>
        <li>You made hotdogs from scratch! Get your favorite condiments out and serve them up!</li>
