The butter and bouillon mixture gives these air fryer hamburger patties a dark grilled color and deep beefy flavor</p>
    <p>Hamburgers are customarily eaten as a sandwich, between two halves of a round bun. mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, and other condiments, along with garnishes of lettuce, onion, tomato, and sliced pickle, constitute the customary dressing; fried eggs and avocado may be added as well.

The patty itself is often seasoned or augmented with chopped onions, spices, or bread crumbs before cooking.</p>
